### Tradeoffs Between Priors and Data
- How do strong priors affect Bayesian models? Is my model going to be subjective if I start with a strong prior that is wrong? Why would I use Bayesian methods if I have no prior beliefs? (all flat priors)
- Do we update the prior during bayesian inference? Or we only update the posterior?
- Walkthrough about the use of priors, when they get used and the effect they have.
    - Are the updated when we update data?
    - If we start with a strong prior that is wrong, how will this affec the model?
    - How long does it take for data to overcome a prior?
- Have a toy example with bayesian linear regression, maybe an example with interpretabble coefficients, like weight VS height. So we can start with a strong prior and not a lot of data, then test out weak priors with lots of data, etc.
