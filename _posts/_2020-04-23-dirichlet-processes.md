## What is the goal?

This post serves as reference notes for myself on the relationships between the Beta and Dirichlet distributions. It can be useful if you have have previous exposure to Bayesian inference and conjugate priors, but I'll still concicely explain conjugate priors.

You're probably here becuase you constantly hear about the Beta and/or Dirichlet distributions and want to know more, or at least, why are they here? The goal of this post is to motivate and explain the need for these distributions without convoluted language or math, but instead with plots, code and good ole english.

## Conjugate Prior

A prior and likelihood are conjugate if the resulting posterior has the same distribution as the prior. Some examples of conjugate priors are:

- Beta prior + Binomial likelihood = Beta posterior
- other things


## Beta Distribution

Relationship between Beta distribution and the binomial distribution. Relationship between the continuity of Beta distribution and the discreteness of... something else.. dont remember.

## Dirichlet Distribution

Relationship between Dirichlet distrubition and the Multinomian distrbution.
Also explain the Gamma function and Poisson distribution in relation to the Dirichlet distribution.
