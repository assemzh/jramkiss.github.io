This post serves as refresher notes for myself on the Beta and Dirichlet distributions for when I step away from them for a while.

## Conjugate Priors

A prior and likelihood are conjugate if the resulting posterior has the same distribution as the prior. Some examples of conjugate priors are:

- Beta prior + Binomial likelihood = Beta posterior
- other things


## Beta Distribution

Relationship between Beta distribution and the binomial distribution. Relationship between the continuity of Beta distribution and the discreteness of... something else.. dont remember.

## Dirichlet Distribution

Relationship between Dirichlet distrubition and the Multinomian distrbution.
Also explain the Gamma function and Poisson distribution in relation to the Dirichlet distribution.

## Questions
- What do samples from a dirichlet distribution look like?
- What do samples from a Dirichlet process look like?
- What is an analogy for a Dirichlet process? Dice analogy where a Dirichlet distribution is limited in the number of sides (finite dimensional) but a Dirichlet process isn't limited by the number of sides (infinite dimensional)
- Ways of deriving the Dirichlet process
