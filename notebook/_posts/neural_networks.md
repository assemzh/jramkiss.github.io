This post will break down neural networks into their most basic components and review them one by one. It should serve as a refresher of the fundamentals for those who have already seen neural networks, and an introduction to the intuition behind the math for newcommers. 

Before we start, I'd like to outline some key words that will be thrown around in this post. If you are already familiar with neural networks, you can skip this section. The purpose of this section is to offer explanations for the terminology that will be used below, so that the reader can have a clear mental picture of neural networks throughout the post. 

- Weights
- Nodes
- Activation
- Input and Output layers
- Hidden layers
